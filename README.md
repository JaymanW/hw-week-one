# Week One HW Project

## Description

This project was designed to update an existing website to match best practices in semantic HTML and CSS. These changes will make this website easier to maintenance in the future, and will provide a better accessability experience for site users. In addition to semantic changes, several updates were made to the site such as a nav link fix, improved CSS layout, and a better organization of HTML content.

Live deployment of the site can be found at: https://jaymanw.github.io/hw-week-one/
